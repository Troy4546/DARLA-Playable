# DARLA-Playable
 
Hey ! Thanks for checking out DARLA, I hope you enjoy it. Here are some things you should know about the game 

--Controls-- 

 W
ASD - Move around

[RMB] - Flash torch (you can hold this input)


--Things To Keep In Mind--

As this is a work-in-progress, you may find some features missing or slightly unpolished but that's alright because I'm still working on it! (probably as we speak)

Some things that might feel weird include
- Death (in-game) it is abrupt and the game instantly reloads when you die 
- Missing narrative / dialogue in-game
- Music & SFX cannot be toggled at the moment
- You can only play with a mouse & keyboard for now
